This directory contains code for the FASTEM4/5/6 ocean surface microwave emissivity models
from the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) as well as the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS)
ocean emissivity model. To run the FASTEM code you will first need to run the Makefile in the
fastem_lib directory to create the library file (libfastem.a). In the main directory the
routine Fastem.f90 allows the FASTEM models to be run independent of CRTM. The sample program
cmpr_emis.f90 will compute emissivity using four different models including FASTEM4, FASTEM5,
FASTEM6, and RSS. See comments in cmpr_emis.f90 header for information on inputs/outputs etc.

Directories

fastem_lib:  Contains all the required routines from CRTM to run the FASTEM models. Set up to
             create an library archive file (libfastem.a), which is then linked to in order to
             call the Fastem routine from the main calling program

fastem_data: Contains the input data files for FASTEM4, FASTEM5, and FASTEM6

rss_data:    Contains the input data files for the RSS emissivity code
